        <h1>Welcome to our Website! We are the GitGang!</h1>
        <p>
          In the ever-evolving world of software development, collaboration and
          efficient project management are essential. That’s where GitGang comes
          in—a team of developers who have embraced the power of Git and GitHub
          to streamline their coding process, avoid mistakes, and work together
          smoothly. Git records a history of every change made, making it easy
          to go back to previous versions if necessary. Each team member can
          work on their own “branch,” a separate version of the project, and
          merge their contributions into the main codebase after review. This
          not only prevents conflicts but also allows for organized
          experimentation and feature development.
        </p>
        <h2>Importance of Version Control</h2>
        <p>
          Version control is crucial because it helps teams like GitGang avoid
          chaos in code management. Without it, there would be no structured way
          to handle changes, and developers might accidentally overwrite each
          other’s work. This feature is invaluable in environments where
          multiple people are contributing, making GitHub an essential tool in
          modern development practices. Whether you're a solo developer or part
          of a large team like GitGang, version control is key to maintaining
          clarity, organization, and efficiency in any project.
